And we announced the main tracks: Cloud, Mobile and Indie Game Development.</p>\n            <p>I designed the Mayan Calendar as a center piece of the main page. It was not static, each one of the rings was rotating at different speeds indicating that time cannot be stopped end the end of the world was approaching.</p>\n            <p>Once the main page was finished I dedicated my time to the Backoffice. I wanted to create a codebase not only for 2012's edition but for other editions to come.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper col-xs-12 col-sm-4 first-xs last-sm\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[1], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-left\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[3], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <p>Since I like to innovate in my projects this one was no different. In BcnDevCon 2012 I introduced the <b>Tags section</b>.</p>\n            <p>In BcnDevCon 2011 I learned that quite a few people were not sure to submit a paper because they didn't know if people would vote for that. The Tags section was created months ago before the conference and allowed attendees to ask for topics they wanted to learn about.</p>\n            <p>For example, they could submit tags like Android, Angular, Unity... etc. Once these tags were validated, registered users could vote adding a very interesting info to the people thinking of submitting papers, since they now knew if people was interested or not in a specific topic.</p>\n            <p>Each one of the Tags had social Twitter and Email buttons so they could promote their own tag and at the same time, the Conference.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-right\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-8\">\n            <p>Tags section wasn't the only new feature for 2012's edition. Another lesson I learned from BcnDevCon 2011 is that in a conference scheduling should always be accessible, downloadable and easy to update. (if possible)</p>\n            <p>If you print a schedule and something changes or you have to reschedule some session (IT ALWAYS HAPPENS) it's really difficult to communicate this to all attendees only with social networks and scribbling over posters.</p>\n            <p>I added entities such as Room, Session, Speaker and all of them were bound to a given Edition. So, for example, you could create Room A, Room B and Room C for 2012's edition and have different ones in the next one.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper col-xs-12 col-sm-4 first-xs last-sm\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[4], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-left\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[5], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <p>On the frontend part I created a Javascript code that adapted the size of the columns to the number of tracks per day, so for example, if the second day of the conference there were only two rooms used each track would occupy 50% of the schedule. If three or more rooms, the schedule would be divided by the number of different rooms for that specific day.</p>\n            <p>But I added an interesting feature and yet another lesson learned from BcnDevCon 2011: <b>Custom Schedulings.</b></p>\n            <p>People was able to mark the sessions they were interested in, so they didn't have to look into the whole scheduling to remember what talks they decided to go to. Not only that, they could also sync to an iCal URL and have an updated and personalised version of the conference scheduling. </p>\n            <p>Oh, and of course you could share your custom scheduling to the social networks.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component component-text col-xs-12\">\n    <p>But there was even more into it, information is power! </p>\n    <p>When I created the backend I added the capacity attribute to the Room Entity, allowing me to describe how many people could we fit in each one per edition.</p>\n    <p>Since people were marking their favorite sessions I was able to forecast if a room was too small or too big for a given session, and then I only had to exchange the room. It was a very interesting feature that saved a lot of headaches.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-right\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-8\">\n            <p>Other small but important sections were <b>Media & Press.</b></p>\n            <p>With this section Sponsors, Speakers, Media Partners (and motivated attendees) could help us promoting the event selecting which kind of banner they liked for their website and a code would be generated for them so they would only have to copy and paste into their HTML.</p>\n            <p>Press section was created to focus and coordinate the media to what we really wanted, we would release two or three press releases before the event with announcements like new Sponsorships, Master Sessions or deadlines.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper col-xs-12 col-sm-4 first-xs last-sm\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[7], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component component-text col-xs-12\">\n    <p>In fact, most of the time I spend on the project was on the Backend side and I couldn't dedicate much on the Frontend or the Design. Some of the other implementations where:</p>\n    <p>A <b>Newsletter service</b> which allowed subscription / unsubscription, templates, preview and emailing to the subscribed users (In later editions we simplified this section using MailChimp)</p>\n    <p>A <b>Ticket system</b> to create invoices and the possibility claim / generate a bill automatically. It basically was a cron task that synchronised users between Eventbrite and our platform. Once a user bought a ticket they received an email with a URL so they could claim for an invoice. This same cron also created a chart comparing the previous and current edition's ticket selling trend. </p>\n    <p>A <b>Volunteer</b> form so we could have all the information organised in the system.</p>\n    <p><b>Appwards</b>: in 2012 edition you could not only submit papers but also your Mobile application or video game to win tickets to the conference.</p>\n    <p>A <a href=\"{{STATIC_URL}}/projects/bcndevcon-videogame.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Videogame</b></a> to collect money for cancer research.

The project was basically to build a full social network around this sport, including timeline, friendships, competition schedulings and an advanced search (I strongly recommended to the client to create a mobile app instead of a website but I ended implementing a draft of the last one)</p>\n            <p>The project ended up being quite interesting, there was a lot of features to be implemented, and the design was also on me so it was a great opportunity to increase my experience.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-right\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-8\">\n            <p>The project didn't have much budget so I had to choose a framework to save some time and reuse some code. Also, the idea was to develop a prototype and then in the case of finding investors, we would build the website scalable from scratch.</p>\n            <p>I decided to go with Drupal. I had experience with the platform, it had a lot of community ready features, it also contained and extendable admin so it looked like the best choice.</p>\n            <p>But building a community was not only about registering, logging in and out but there were a lot of specific modules that had to be build to satisfy the client requirements.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper col-xs-12 col-sm-4 first-xs last-sm\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[1], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component component-text col-xs-12\">\n    <p>These are some of the Modules that I had to develop myself:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>\n            <b>News Module</b>: Basically a page with the excerpt of the last news from all the specialized sources on the internet. During the phase 2 of the project, I had to implement some Python Spiders to gather that information. As I said only the excerpt would be used, the user would be redirected to the source website on click.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <b>History Module</b>: The History module tracked all the activity from a user. For example, when modifying his career, uploading new pictures, making new friends and of course you could also just write a message for others to see. Once you friended someone, you could also see specific information such us the phone number or email address.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <b>Friendship Module</b>: This module allowed to make friends to any other user in the community. You could send a friend request, accept it and unfriend. Once you accepted the friendship, all new friend updates would appear on its timeline.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <b>Competition, Team, Season and Match Modules</b>: Well that was a big one.<br/><br/>\n            <p>The platform should allow admin users to create competitions with the options such as size (International, National, Local and Friendly), modality (Regularity or Season, Regularity with Back Counting, Sudden Death - 1 leg, Sudden Death - 2 legs and Final Four), category (Senior, Senior Elite, U21, U18, U16), recurrence (Seasonal, Seasonal - Spanish, Every 2 years, Every 4 years or Other) and finally how much points was a victory worth.</p>\n            <p>For the Seasonal recurrence, you had the chance to create multiple seasons and therefore having the whole history of matches of a certain league or championship. For example, you should be able to check the ranking of the Spanish league on the Season 2001-2002 if entered on the database.</p>\n            <p>All these combinations would be enough so any competition could be entered on the platform without problems.</p>\n            <p>In addition, once the information was available in the database, each ranking was rendered dynamically. So for example, if you would change the punctuation for a victory or a draw, that would also change the way it would be displayed.</p>\n            <p>Finally, the user was also able to display a full calendar and subscribe to the iCal / Calendar file.</p>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-left\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper  col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[6], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <p>But if there was a module I enjoyed building that was the <b>Advanced Search Module</b>. This module allowed searching for any kind of profile quite easily.</p>\n            <p>For example, you could type <i>attacker sweeper active</i> and the result would be displayed on the map. Or you could type  <i>coach inactive</i> to search for people looking for a Coach job.</p>\n            <p>When users edited their profile they had the chance to activate the job search visibility, so they would appear in the advanced search for similar jobs they had in their career.</p>\n            <p>Also, there was an even more advanced search so you could specify the Country, Nationality, Age and much more.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component component-text col-xs-12\">\n    <p>Sadly the project never ended having the go live, since there were no funds to finish the Phase 1.</p>\n</section>","slug":"hockeylink","skills":"js,php,illustrator,photoshop","preview":"AwgJCg8GAAQ","isFeatured":1,"relatedTo":"BQsECAUPCQE,DAwAAg0MAA0","src":"/images/projects/hockeylink/hockeylink-0.jpg","alt":"Hockeylink branding logo with the search map behind"},{"id":"DAwAAg0MAA0","title":"Faisme conceptual mood API","subtitle":"Faisme, an API to assign avatars to your moods","created":"1314835200","background":"DAcCBwgPCgc","demo":"","content":"<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-left\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[0], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <h3 class=\"component-subtitle\">about the project</h3>\n            <p>Although Facebook allows now to add expressions to posts this was not always the case.</p>\n            <p>It is clear that when people are chatting, commenting or posting on the social networks, they use emojis or icons to put more emphasis to the emotions their are feeling at that moment.</p>\n            <p>That's when the idea came up, why is not the profile picture reflecting those emotions?</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-right\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-8\">\n            <p>There was already at least one service (Gravatar) providing an API to assign one or more emails to one profile image. This API allowed third party platforms to auto-fill the profile picture with that image, instead of the dummy one giving more life to the website.</p>\n            <p>I decided to take that one step further, I wanted to create an API to store not one but eight images based on the basic human emotions states: Happy, Joking, Joy, Surprise, Sad, Angry, Sick and Fear. (OK, Joking is not really a status but it's used a lot)</p>\n            <p>These emotions could now be used in chats, comment threads, video games... everywhere.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper col-xs-12 col-sm-4 first-xs last-sm\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[7], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"project-section component combination combination--media-left\">\n    <div class=\"combination-elements row\">\n        <div class=\"combination-element combination-media-wrapper  col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <div class=\"combination-media\">\n                {{media.create(media=project.gallery[8], STATIC_URL=STATIC_URL)}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"component-text col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n            <p>Obviously, this service does not much sense business-wise. How do you maintain such platform?</p>\n            <p>So I decided that you could not only store those images but also set your current status. Setting your current status added a new dimension to the platform because you could increase the conversion rating of a lead adding the mood to the mix. For example, if a user is happy, is more likely to go to a party but if is sad is more likely to buy a movie at home.</p>\n            <p>I was inspired and I didn't stop there. The next step? widgets!</p>\n            <p>I created widgets that instead of voting up and down, you could express your feelings about it.
